StreamSign is a web application built using the Streamlit framework for the classification of sign language alphabet. This project serves as my first interaction with Streamlit, where I explore the capabilities of the framework and demonstrate image classification of sign language letters.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to showcase my proficiency in utilizing the Streamlit framework to develop interactive web applications for image classification tasks. By focusing specifically on the classification of sign language alphabet, the project aims to highlight my understanding of computer vision techniques and deep learning models.

## Features
- Web-based user interface for uploading and classifying images of sign language letters.
- Integration with a pre-trained deep learning model for accurate classification.
- Real-time predictions with user-friendly visualization.

## Getting Started
To get started with StreamSign, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/StreamSign.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `streamlit run app.py`
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the StreamSign interface.
